# PID car
## Description
in this project, we were instructed to design, build, and program a device that uses PID control, with these requirements:

- work together in groups of two
- use only a metro and other standard components in the sigma lab
- use 4 or 6 AA batteries in a battery pack for power
- include a power switch and a LED power indicator
- ensure everything is securely mounted

To commit from VS Code:
If you get an error about user.name and user.email

## Planning 

### planning documents, schedules, etc (change this name)

### Initial design or planning sketches (something like that)

## Design

### Bill of Materials

### Wiring Diagram

maybe include something about the wiring for the h bridge, with a link to the image on adafruit.

### Code 

Don't forget to comment the first 3 lines of your code!   Names,  Title,   and 1line to describe what this thing is supposed to do.

### Build

Cad pictures here, any documentation about the steps to design and build it.

## Reflection

so the assighnment was hard i asked my teachers for help so I recommend asking your teachers for help if you dont know what youre doing, because I kept messing with the PID and I couldnt get it to run smoothly so I asked the teacher for help, I also recommend working with a partner because this will take way too long for you to do it alone,thats about it
