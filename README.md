in this project, we were instructed to design, build, and program a device that uses PID control, with these requirements:

- work together in groups of two
- use only a metro and other standard components in the sigma lab
- use 4 or 6 AA batteries in a battery pack for power
- include a power switch and a LED power indicator
- ensure everything is securely mounted

## Reflection

Most importantly:  What would you tell your past self, or the future engingeering student, to make their life easier with this project, or make their project better, or avoid mistakes you made...
avoid the "dear diary" BS
