# PID car
## Description
in this project, we were instructed to design, build, and program a device that uses PID control, with these requirements:

- work together in groups of two
- use only a metro and other standard components in the sigma lab
- use 4 or 6 AA batteries in a battery pack for power
- include a power switch and a LED power indicator
- ensure everything is securely mounted

## Planning 

### planning documents, schedules, etc (change this name)

### Initial design or planning sketches (something like that)

## Design

### Bill of Materials

### Wiring Diagram

maybe include something about the wiring for the h bridge, with a link to the image on adafruit.

### Code 

Don't forget to comment the first 3 lines of your code!   Names,  Title,   and 1line to describe what this thing is supposed to do.

### Build

Cad pictures here, any documentation about the steps to design and build it.

## Reflection

Most importantly:  What would you tell your past self, or the future engingeering student, to make their life easier with this project, or make their project better, or avoid mistakes you made...
avoid the "dear diary" BS
