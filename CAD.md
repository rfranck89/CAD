# PID car

### Description
in this project, we were instructed to design, build, and program a device that uses PID control, with these requirements:
- work together in groups of two                                                   
- use only a metro and other standard components in the sigma lab                   
- use 4 or 6 AA batteries in a battery pack for power                             
- include a power switch and a LED power indicator                                
- ensure everything is securely mounted
